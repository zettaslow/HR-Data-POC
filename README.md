This is an interview project I've done that displays HR Data based out of a JSON file in a React Data Visualization

# Startup Instructions

I've compiled the prod version already, it can be run from the `out` folder with:

```bash
npx http-server -o http://localhost:8080/index.html
```

or you can try running the dev build with

```bash
npm run dev
```

Have fun!
