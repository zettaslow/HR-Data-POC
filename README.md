This is an interview project I've done that displays HR Data based out of a JSON file in a React Data Visualization. As a user you can click into departments to view hierarchical organization data of employees, departments, and number of direct reports. 

This was built in Next.js, SASS and React components I've built myself.

You can try running the dev build with

```
